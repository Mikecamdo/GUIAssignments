        Welcome to my website! My name is Michael Doherty, and I'm a junior
        studying Computer Science at Southern Methodist University. I'm from
        Jackson, Mississippi, and I have two brothers and one sister. I like
        playing basketball, playing video games, watching movies and TV shows,
        and talking with my friends! Feel free to browse this site to find out more about me, like what classes I've taken at SMU and an interesting story from my high school bowling days!

          <h4 class="bodyHeaders">"Solid: A Bowling Story"</h4>
          <h5 class="bodyHeaders">by Michael Doherty</h5>
          <h6 class="bodyHeaders">with contributions by the 2019 St. Joe High School Bowling Team</h6>
          <p>
            This is an anecdote from my childhood. In high school, I was part of my school's bowling team. In general, our team wasn't that great, but we still were able to participate in the district tournament. Because only 3 teams (including us) participated in the tournament, we were able to finish in the top 2 and advance to the final (which is a Baker's Game, a match in which all five players from the same team bowl together to make one game). Doubting our abilities (as we had been crushed by our opponenets during the regular part of the tournament), we decided to yell "Soliddddddd" right after every turn taken by our team, regardless of the outcome. Somehow, this amazing strategy psyched out our opponenets, causing them to perform horribly and lose the Baker's Game to us. Thus, one of the greatest underdog stories in sports was born, and a new catchphrase would inspire millions of people to overcome impossible odds to achieve victory.

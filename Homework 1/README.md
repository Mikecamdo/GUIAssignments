# Homework 1

## Assignment Details

For Homework #1, you will be creating a webpage about YOU!  While this assignment is intentionally open to interpretation, all submissions need to include the following content:

- a paragraph introduction
- a picture of yourself
- a list of hobbies on interests
- a list of courses you are taking or have taken
- a form to contact you (it does NOT need to actually work)

In general, I am looking for you to be creative and make a good effort to explore the many features of HTML and CSS. At minimal, however, your assignment needs to meet the following requirements:

Find ways to make use of the following tags:
- &lt;main&gt;
- &lt;header>
- &lt;footer>
- &lt;article>
- &lt;section>
- &lt;p>
- &lt;img>
- &lt;h1>, &lt;h2>, etc.
- &lt;table> (must be used to display tabular data)
- &lt;ol> or &lt;ul>
- &lt;a>
- &lt;input>, &lt;select> or &lt;textarea> (don’t forget your form tag and labels!)
- &lt;button>

Find ways to use the following CSS selectors:
- wildcard
- element
- id
- class
- attribute
- pseudo-class
- combined - any (require any of these selectors)
- combined - all (require all of these selectors)
- contextual

Find ways to use the following CSS style properties:
- box-sizing (should be applied globally)
- margin
- padding
- border (or child properties of border)
- position (specifically, absolute and relative positioning)
- display
- float (don’t forget to clear!)
- overflow
- color
- background
- border-radius
- opacity
- z-index
- font (or child property of font)

All measurements should be in relative units

All styles must be in a CSS file

I will not be grading on aesthetics, but I do expect to see effort. That may mean doing more than just the minimal requirements. Styles, for example, should be used in ways that make sense. Be creative!

DO NOT USE ANY 3RD PARTY LIBRARIES

YOUR SUBMISSION SHOULD ONLY HAVE ONE HTML FILE

## Implementation Details
My website contains various fun facts about me, such as classes I've taken at SMU, things I'm interested in, and my favorite Marvel Movies.
It also includes a picture of myself and "The Vanishing Man", who disappears when you hover over him.

To view the website, simply download the source code and open index.html.
